Generic Summarization and Keyphrase Extraction Using Mutual Reinforcement Principle and Sentence Clustering

#A novel method for (it simultaneous) keyphrase extraction and generic text summarization is proposed by modeling a text document as weighted undirected and weighted bipartite graphs. Spectral graph clustering algorithms are used for partitioning sentences of the document into topical groups with sentence link priors being exploited to enhance clustering quality. Within each topical group, a mutual reinforcement principle is used to generate saliency scores for keyphrases and sentences. Keyphrases and sentences ranked according to their saliency scores are then selected for inclusion in the top keyword list and summaries of the document. The idea of building a hierarchy of summaries for a document capturing different levels of granularity is also briefly discussed. Our method is illustrated using some extensive examples from news articles, news broadcast transcripts and web documents.
