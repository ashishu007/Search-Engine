An Experimental Comparison of Naive Bayesian and Keyword-Based Anti-Spam Filtering with Personal E-mail Messages

#The growing problem of unsolicited bulk e-mail, also known as "spam", has generated a need for reliable anti-spam e-mail filters. Filters of this type have so far been based mostly on manually constructed keyword patterns. An alternative approach has recently been proposed, whereby a Naive Bayesian classifier is trained automatically to detect spam messages. We test this approach on a large number of personal e-mail messages, which we make publicly available in "encrypted" form contributing towards standard benchmarks. We introduce appropriate cost-sensitive measures, investigating at the same time the effort of attribute-set size, training-corpus size, lemmatization, and stop lists, issues that have not been explored in previous experiments. Finally, the Naive Bayesian filter is compared, in terms of performance, to a filter that uses keyword patterns, and which is part of a widely used a-mail reader.
