Towards New Measures of Information Retrieval Evaluation

#All of the methods currently used to evaluate information retrieval (IR) systems have limitations in their ability to measure how well users are able to acquire information. We utilized an approach to assessing information obtained based on the users ability to answer questions from a short-answer test. Senior medical students took the ten question test and then searched one of the two IR systems on the five questions for which they were least certain of the answer. Our resluts showed that pre-searching scores on the test were low but that searching yielded a high proportion of answers with both systems. These methods are able to measure information obtained, and will be used in subsequent studies to assess differences among IR systems.
