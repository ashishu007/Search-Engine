On-Line New Event Detection and Tracking

#We define and describe the related problems of new event detection and event tracking within a stream of broadcast news stories. We focus on a strict on-line setting i.e., the system must make decisions about one story before looking at any subsequent stories. Our approach to detection uses a single pass clustering algorithm and a novel thresholding model that incorporates the properties of events as a major component. Our approach to tracking is similar to typical information filtering methods. We discuss the value of  "surprising" features that have unusual occurrence characteristics, and briefly explore on-line adaptive filtering to handle evolving events in the news.
