An Architecture for Implementing Extensible Information-Seeking Environments

# A user-interface architecture, called FireWorks, is described. It consists of a domain-specific toolkit and frameworks for building information retrieval applications. The architecture's expressiveness is demonstrated by first describing an example application, which is designed to help searches co-ordinate access to multiple on-line sources. Second, FireWorks is compared to a similar architecture, called InfoGrid. The comparison focuses debate on what software abstractions are required for implementing a range of effective environments for informtion seeking.
