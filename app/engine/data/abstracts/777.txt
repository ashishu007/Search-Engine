Inverted File Search Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering

#This paper explores the possibility of using a disk based inverted file structure for collaborative filtering. Our hypothesis is that this allows for faster calculation of predictions and also that early termination heuristics may be used to further speed up the filtering process. In an experiment on the EachMovie dataset this was tested. Our results indicate that the inverted file structure is 3 to 5 times faster than general in-memory vector search. Also, the Continue termination heuristic produces very good predictions.
