Robust Temporal and Spectral Modeling for Query By Melody

#Query by melody is the problem of retrieving musical performances from melodies. Retrieval of real performances is complicated due to the large number of variations in performing a melody and the presence of colored accompaniment noise. We describe a simple yet effective probabilistic model for this task. We describe a generative model that is rich enough to capture the spectral and temporal variations of musical performances and allows for tractable melody retrieval. While most of previous studies on music retrieval from melodies were performed with either synthetic (e.g. Midi) data or with monophonic (single instrument) performances, we performed experiments in retrieving live and studio recordings of operas that contain a leading vocalist and rich instrumental accompaniment. Our results show that the probabilistic approach we propose is effective and can be scaled to massive datasets.
