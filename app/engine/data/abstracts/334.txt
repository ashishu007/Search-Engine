On the Interrelationship of Dictionary Size and Completeness

# When dictionaries for specify application or subject fields are derived from a text collection, the frequency distribution of the term in the collection gives information about the expected completeness of the dictionary. If only a subset of the terms in the collection t to be included in the dictionary, the completeness of the dictionary can be optimised with respect to dictionary tie. In this paper, formulas for the relationship between the frequency distribution of the terms in the collection and expected dictionary completeness are derived. First we regard one-dimensional dictionaries where the (non-trivial) terms occurring in the texts to be included in the dictionary. Then we describe the case of two dimensional dictionaries, which are needed for example for automatic indexing with a controlled vocabulary; here relationship between text terms and descriptor from the prescribed vocabulary have to be stored in the dictionary. For both cues, formulas for the interpolation and extrapolation with respect to different collection sizes are derived. We give experimental results for one-dimensional dictionaries and show how the completeness can be estimated and optimised.
