Natural Language vs. Boolean Query Evaluation: A Comparison of Retrieval Performance

#The results of experiments comparing the relative performance of natural language and Boolean query formulations are presented. The experiments show that on average a current generation natural language system provides better retrieval performance than expert searchers using a Boolean retrieval system when searching full-text legal materials. Methodological issues are reviewed and the effect of database size on query formulation strategy is discussed.
