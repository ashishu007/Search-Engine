Visualizing Search Results: Some Alternatives to Query-Document Similarity

#A digital library of computer science literature, Envision provides powerful information visualisation by displaying search results as a matrix of icons, with layout semantics under user control. Envision's Graphic view interacts with an Item Summary Window giving users access to bibliographic information, abstracts, and full content.

Formative usability evaluation results show how great user satisfaction with Envision's style of presentation and the document characteristics visualized.
