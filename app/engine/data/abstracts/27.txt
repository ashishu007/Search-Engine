Transfer Learning for Cross-Lingual Sentiment Classification with Weakly Shared Deep Neural Networks

#Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of data in a label-scarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a label-rich language. The fundamental challenge of cross-lingual learning stems from a lack of overlap between the feature spaces of source language data and that of target language data. To address this challenge, previous studies have been performed to make use of the translated resources for sentiment classification in the target language, and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the source language and the translated target language. In this paper, to address the above challenge, we present a novel deep neural network structure, called Weakly Shared Deep Neural Networks (WSDNNs), to transfer the cross-lingual information from a source language to a target language. To share the sentiment labels between two languages, we build multiple weakly shared layers of features. It allows to represent both shared inter-language features and language-specific ones, making this structure more flexible and powerful in capturing the feature representations of bilingual languages jointly. We conduct a set of experiments with cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks on multilingual Amazon product reviews. The empirical results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual sentiment classification, especially when label data is scarce.
