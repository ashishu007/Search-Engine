Document Filtering Method Using Non-Relevant Information Profile

#Document filtering is a task to retrieve documents relevent to a user's profile from a flow of documents. Generally, filtering systems calculate the similarity between the profile and each incoming document, and retrieve documents with similarity higher than a threshold. However, many systems set a relatively high threshold to reduce retrieval of non-relevant documents, which results in the ignorance of many relevant documents. In this paper, we propose the use of a non-relevant information profile to reduce the mistaken retrieval of non-relevant documents. Results from experiments show that this filter has successfully rejected a sufficient number of non-relevant documents, resulting in an improvement of filtering performance.
