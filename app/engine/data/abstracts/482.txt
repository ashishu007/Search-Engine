Searching Distributed Collections with Inference Networks

#The use of information retrieval systems in networked environments raises a new set of issues that have received little attention. These issues include ranking document col-lections for relevance to a query, selecting the best set of collections from a ranked list, and merging the document rankings that are returned from a set of collections. This paper describes methods of addressing each issue in the in-ference network model, discusses their implementation in the INQUERY system, and presents experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.
