Deriving Concept Hierarchies from Text

#This paper presents a means of automatically deriving a hierarchical organization of concepts from a set of documents without use of training data or standard clustering techniques. Instead, salient words and phrases extracted from the documents are organized hierarchically using a type of co-occurrence known as subsumption. The resulting structure is displayed as a series of hierarchical menus. When generated from a set of retrieved documents, a user browsing the menus is provided with a detailed overview of their content in a manner distinct from existing overview and summarization techniques. The methods used to build the structure are simple, but appear to be effective: a small-scale user study reveals that the generated hierarchy possesses properties expected of such a structure in that general terms are placed at the top levels leading to related and more specific terms below. The formation and presentation of the hierarchy is described along with the user study and some other
informal evaluations.
