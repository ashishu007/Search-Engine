Pat-tree-based Keyword Extraction for Chinese Information Retrieval

#Considering the urgent need to promote Chineese Information Retrieval, in this paper we will raise the significance of keyword extraction using a new PAT-tree-based approach, which is efficient in automatic key-word extraction from a set of relevant Chinese documents. This approach has been successfully applied in several IR researches, such as document classification, book indexing and relevance feedback. Many Chineese language processing applications therefore step ahead from character level to word/phrase level.
