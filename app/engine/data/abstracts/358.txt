A Case-Based Architecture for A Dialogue Manager for Information Seeking

#In this paper, we propose a case-based architecture for a dialogue manager. The dialogue manager is one of the main components of the cognitive layer of an interface system for information-seeking processes. Information-seeking is a highly exploratory and navigational process and needs therefore elaborated interaction functionality. In our approach, this functionality will be provided by the dialogue manager operating on a set of case-based dialogue plans. In a case-based dialogue plans. In a case-based planning system a new plan will be generated by retrieving the plan which is most appropriate to the users goals and adapting it dynamically during the ongoing dialogue. We propose a case-based architecture for two reasons. First, operating on old solutions provides a coherent framework which prevents the user from being 'lost in hyperspace'. Second, it allows flexible adaptations, domain dependant ones, using perspectives on domain objects, and domain independant ones, that change the sequence of dialogue steps.
