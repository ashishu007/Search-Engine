On the Allocation of Documents in Multiprocessor Information Retrieval Systems

#Information retrieval is the selection of documents that are potentially relevant to a user's information need. Given the vast volume of data stored in modern information information retrieval systems, searching the document database requires vast computational resources. To meet these computational demands, various researchershave developed parallel information retrieval systems. As efficient exploitation of parallelism demands fast access to the documents, data organisation and placement significantly affect the total processing time. We describe and evaluate a data placement strategy for distributed memory, distributed I/O multicomputers. Initially, a formal description of the Multiprocessor Document Allocation Problem (MDAP) and a proof that MDAP is NP Complete are presented. A document allocation algorithm for MDAP based on Genetic Algorithms is developed. This algorithm assumes that the documents are clustered using any one of the many clustering algorithms. We define a cost function for the derived allocation and evaluate the performance of our algorithm using this function. As part of the experimental analysis, the effects of varying the number of documnets and their distribution accross the clusters as well as the exploitation of various different architectural interconnection topologies are studied. We also experiment with several parameters common to Genetic Algorithms, e.g., the probability of mutation and the population size.
