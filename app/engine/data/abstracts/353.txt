The CORE Electronic Chemistry Library

#A major online file of chemical journal literature complete with graphics is being developed to test the usability of fully electronic access to documents. The test file will include ten years of the American Chemical Society's online journals, supplemented with the graphics from the paper publication, and the indexing of the articles from Chemical Abstracts. Our goals are (1) to assess the effectiveness 
and acceptability of electronic access to primary journals as compared with paper, and (2) to identify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an electronic system of journals, including in particular a comparison of page image display with Ascii interfaces. This paper describes the chemical journal data, the interfaces for searching and reading it, and the experiments being done.
