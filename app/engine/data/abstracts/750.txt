Term-Specific Smoothing for the Language Modeling Approach to Information Retrieval: The Importance of a Query Term

#This paper follows a formal approach to information retrieval based on statistical language models. By introducing some simple reformulations of the basic language modelling approach we introduce the notion of (em importance) of a query term. The importance of a query term is an unknown parameter that explicitly models which of the query terms are generated from the relevant documents (the important terms), and which are not (the unimportant terms). The new language modeling approach is shown to explain a number of practical facts of today's information retrieval systems that are not very well explained by the current state of information retrieval theory, including stop words, mandatory terms, coordination level ranking and retrieval using phrases.
