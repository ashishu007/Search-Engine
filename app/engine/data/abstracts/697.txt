A Practical Hypertext Categorization Method using Links and Incrementally Available Class Information

#As WWW grows at an increasing speed, a classifier targeted at hypertext has become in high demand. While document categorization is quite a mature, the issue of utilizing hypertext structure and hyperlinks has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a practical method for enhancing both the speed and quality of hypertext categorization using hyperlinks. In comparison against a recently proposed technique that appears to be the only one of the kind, we obtained up to 18.5% improvement in effectiveness while reducing the processing time dramatically. We attempt to explain through experiments what factors contribute to the improvement.
