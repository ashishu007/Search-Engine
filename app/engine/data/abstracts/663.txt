A Probabilistic Solution to the Selection and Fusion Problem in Distributed Information Retrieval

#A model for optimal information retrieval over a distributed document collection is described and experimentally evaluated. The fusion of retrieval results corresponding to document sub collections is performed according to the Probability Ranking Principle. Part of the model is a selection criterion for effectively limiting the ranking process to a sub-set of sub collections.
