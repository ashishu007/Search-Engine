A New Character-based Indexing Organization using Frequency Data for Japanese Documents

#A character based indexing is preferable for Japanese IR systems since Japanese words are not segmented. This paper proposes a new character indexing method to enhance our previous method which divided character pair index entries into disjoint groups based on character classes. Since frequency data is used to determine hashed entries for character pairs and to establish a special string index, both search speed and precision are improved. Moreover, bit strings are managed using small and large blocks, so registration and retrieval are accelerated. Experiments using patent abstracts showed these proposals are quite effective.
