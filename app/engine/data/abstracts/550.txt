Document Filtering With Inference Networks

# Although statistical retrieval models are now accepted widely, there has been little research on how to adapt them tothedemands ofhighspeed documeut filtering. The prob-lems of document retrieval and document filtering are similar at an abstract level, but the architectures required, the optirnizations that are possible, andthecluality of the infer-mation available, are all different. This paper describes a new statistical document filtering system called InRoute, the problems of flteringe ffectiveness and efficiency that arise with such a system, and experiments with various solutions.
